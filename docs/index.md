Welcome!
Iâ€™m Gerald Wang, an Associate Professor at the University of Regina, Canada.
Iâ€™ve been teaching circuits and systems for years, and since 2019 â€” when COVID began â€” Iâ€™ve been planning to create an open-source tutorial series. I believe a comprehensive resource like this can help students learn more productively and flexibly.

Now, I finally start this work.
This tutorial series will cover topics including:

- Resistive Network
- Impedance Network
- Transient Analysis
- Power Analysis
- Varied Frequency Network
- Laplace Transform

This is an ongoing project. Currently, I have only finished the Node Analysis of the Resistive Network Part. There is a long way to go.

I will try to add more material ASAP. 

You can find all the material including LaTeX equations and circuit diagrams on GitHub: ðŸ›  github.com/LCGeraldWang
