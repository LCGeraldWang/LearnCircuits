# Loop Analysis

Nodal analysis is a fundamental method in circuit theory used to determine the voltage at various points (nodes) in an electrical circuit. The basic concepts include:

- **Loop**: A closed path in a circuit.
- **Inner loop or mesh**: An inner loop or mesh is a loop that does not enclose any other loop.
- **Loop current**: The current goes through a loop.

## Nodal Analysis Steps

- Step 1: Step 1: Label loop current for inner loops.
- Step 2: Write KVL for each loop.
- Step 3: Solve the system of equations
